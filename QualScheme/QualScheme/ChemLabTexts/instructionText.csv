Welcome to the Qual Scheme Lab!  Youa re given a solution containing one or more ions.  Your goal is to determine what ions are present through qualitative analysis of chemical reactions.,"In the qual scheme lab, you will foruc on the identification of ions basead on the colors of the salts and solutions which they form, the colors which they impart to flames, and the solubilities of the salts formed with various combinations of ions.  The groups in this simulation can be divided into three groups based on salt solubilities.  Group I ions will form insoluble chloride salts, Group II will form insoluble sulfides, and Group III will form either carbonates or soluble salts.    Anions will be treated as their own seperate groups, and precipitate as insoluble barium salts, insoluble silver chloride, or will be completely soluble.","The chloride salts of most common cations are water soluble, but there are notable exceptions: silver, lead, and mercury chloride.  The addition of any solution containing a moderate concentration of chloride ions, such as hydrochloric acid or table salt, to a solution containing one of these ions will result in the formation of a white precipitate.  The dissolution of lead chloride is strongly endothermic, soincreasing the temperature will increase solubility by Le Chatelier's principle.  Thus while lead chloride is only sparingly soluble in cold water, it is moderately soluble in hot water, which can be used to seperate it from other Group I cations.  Once seperated from the other Group I ions, the presence of lead ions can be confirmed by precipitating it as a sulfate or chromate.  Addition of ammonia to solutions containing silver ions will form Ag(NH3)2+, which binds much less tightly to the chloride ion than the silver ion, making silver chloride dissolve in moderately concentrated solutions of ammonia.  The addition of a strong acid reduces the concentration of ammonia by neutralizing it, and shifting the equilibrium back to the left and reprecipitating silver chloride.  Of the Group I ions, mercury chloride is the least soluble.  Mercury chloride will not dissolve in hot water or aqueous ammonia, but undergoes disproportionation, or simultaneous oxidation and reduction, in aqueous ammonioa, forming a mixture containing a metallic mercury solid.","To a 3 mL sample of the solution to be tested, add three drops of 6M HCl and stir.  If a precipitate forms, add 1 mL more HCl and stir.  Centrifuge, then check for complete precipitation by adding one drop of HCl to the supernatant liquid.  If additional precipitate forms, continue to add HCl until no further precipitation is observed.  Centrifuge and decant the supernatant liquid.  If the test solution is known to contain only ions of Group I, the decantate can be discarded.  Otherwise, the solution should be saved for the Groups II and III tests.  Wash the precipitate with two 1mL portions of cold water and label P1.","Add 2mL of DI water to the precipitate from step 1 (labeled P1) and heat to nearly boiling in a hot water bath.  Centrifuge and decant.  If any of the precipitate P1 remains, wash it with 2 mL of hot water from the water back and save to test for silver and mercury ions.","Divide the decantate from step 2 into two equal portions.  To one portion, add 6M sulfuric acid.  A white precipitate will confirm the presence of lead ions.  To the other, add potassium permanganate.  A yellow precipitate will further confirm presence of lead ions. If the presence of lead has been confirmed, the precipitate P1 should be washed with two 1mL portions of hot water.  ","To the residual precipitate, if any, from step 2, add 1mL aqueous ammonia.  Centrifuge and decant the supernatant liquid into a separate test tube and label it.  A dark residue will confirm the presence of mercury ions in the unknown.",Slowly add 6M nitric acid to the decantate from step 4 until it is acidic to litmus (blue litmus paper should turn red).  A white precipitate at this point confirms the presence of silver ions in the unknown.
